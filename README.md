# Go Adventure App
The Go Adventure app is about traveling the world one monument at a time, and it's built on rails.

# How This Works
* When you arrive on the Go Adventure website you will be prompted to create a user log-in. This log-in will allow you to save the monuments that you've searched, and add comments to each individual one.
* These comments can be added before your trip to remind yourself of certain facts or details that you would like to see once there, or after your trip if you want to write down certain facts that you learned from your visit. 
* If your travel plans change then the delete button is there to completely remove an individual monument that you had saved on your personal page.

# User Stories
* As a user, I can log in search for attractions to visit by city name, and decide to add a particular monument to my travel list, or search for another adventure.
* As a user, I can add, edit or delete a comment related to a saved adventure on my travel list.
* As a user, I can delete an adventure from my travel list.
* As a user, I can update my profile settings by changing my email address, password, or delete my account all together.
